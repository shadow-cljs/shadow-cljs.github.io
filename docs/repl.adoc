= REPL

The REPL is a very powerful tool to have when working with Clojure(Script) code. `shadow-cljs` provides several built-in variants that let you get started quickly as well as variants that are integrated into your standard builds.

When you quickly want to test out some code the built-in REPLs should be enough. If you need more complex setups that also do stuff on their own it is best to use an actual build.

== ClojureScript REPL

By default you can choose between a `node-repl` and a `browser-repl`. They both work similarly and the differentiating factor is that one runs in a managed Node.js process while the others opens a browser window that will be used to eval the actual code.

=== Node REPL [[node-repl]]

```bash
$ shadow-cljs node-repl
```

This starts a blank CLJS REPL with an already connected `node` process.

IMPORTANT: If you exit the Node REPL the `node` process is also killed!

`node-repl` lets you get started without any additional configuration. It has access to all your code via the usual means, ie. `(require '[your.core :as x])`. Since it is not connected to any build it does not do any automatic rebuilding of code when your files change and does not provide hot-reload.

=== Browser REPL [[browser-repl]]

```bash
$ shadow-cljs browser-repl
```

This starts a blank CLJS REPL and will open an associated Browser window where the code will execute. Besides running in the Browser this has all the same functionality as the above `node-repl`.

IMPORTANT: If you close the Browser window the REPL will stop working.

=== Build-specific REPL [[build-repl]]

`node-repl` and `browser-repl` work without any specific build configuration. That means they'll only do whatever you tell them to do but nothing on their own.

If you want to build a specific thing you should configure a build using one of the provided build-targets. Most of them automatically inject the necessary code for a ClojureScript REPL. It should not require any additional configuration. For the build CLJS REPL to work you need 2 things

. a running `watch` for your build
. connect the JS runtime of the `:target`. Meaning if you are using the `:browser` target you need to open a Browser that has the generated JS loaded. For node.js builds that means running the `node` process.

Once you have both you can connect to the CLJS REPL via the command line or from the Clojure REPL.

.CLI
```bash
$ shadow-cljs watch build-id
...

# different terminal
$ shadow-cljs cljs-repl build-id
shadow-cljs - connected to server
[3:1]~cljs.user=>
```

.REPL
```bash
$ shadow-cljs clj-repl
...
[2:0]~shadow.user=> (shadow/watch :browser)
[:browser] Configuring build.
[:browser] Compiling ...
[:browser] Build completed. (341 files, 1 compiled, 0 warnings, 3,19s)
:watching
[2:0]~shadow.user=> (shadow/repl :browser)
[2:1]~cljs.user=>
```

TIP: Type `:repl/quit` to exit the REPL. This will only exit the REPL, the `watch` will remain running.

TIP: You may run multiple `watch` "workers" in parallel and connect/disconnect to their REPLs at any given time.

.No connected runtime error.
``` text
[3:1]~cljs.user=> (js/alert "foo")
There is no connected JS runtime.
```

If you see this you need to open your App in the Browser or start the `node` process.

== Clojure REPL

A Clojure REPL is also provided in addition to the provided ClojureScript REPLs. This is can be used to control the `shadow-cljs` process and run all other build commands through it. You can start with a Clojure REPL and then upgrade it to a CLJS REPL at any point (and switch back).

.Running from the CLI
```bash
$ shadow-cljs clj-repl
...
shadow-cljs - REPL - see (help), :repl/quit to exit
[1:0]~shadow.user=>
```

The `shadow.cljs.devtools.api` namespace has functions that map more or less 1:1 to the CLI counterparts. It is aliased as `shadow` by default.

.Example commands
```clojure
;; shadow-cljs watch foo
(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/watch :foo)
;; this is identical, due to the provided ns alias
(shadow/watch :foo)
;; shadow-cljs watch foo --verbose
(shadow/watch :foo {:verbose true})
;; shadow-cljs compile foo
(shadow/compile :foo)
;; shadow-cljs release foo
(shadow/release :foo)

;; shadow-cljs browser-repl
(shadow/browser-repl)
;; shadow-cljs node-repl
(shadow/node-repl)
;; shadow-cljs cljs-repl foo
(shadow/repl :foo)

;; Once you are in a CLJS REPL you can use
:repl/quit
;; or
:cljs/quit
;; to drop back down to CLJ.
```


=== Embedded [[embedded]]

It is also possible to use `shadow-cljs` entirely from within any other CLJ process. As long as the `thheller/shadow-cljs` artifact was loaded on the classpath you are good to go.

.Example using `lein repl`
```bash
$ lein repl
nREPL server started on port 57098 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:57098
REPL-y 0.4.3, nREPL 0.6.0
Clojure 1.10.0
...

user=> (require '[shadow.cljs.devtools.server :as server])
nil
user=> (server/start!)
...
:shadow.cljs.devtools.server/started
user=> (require '[shadow.cljs.devtools.api :as shadow])
nil
user=> (shadow/compile :foo)
...
```

You can stop the embedded server by running `(shadow.cljs.devtools.server/stop!)`. This will also stop all running build processes.

IMPORTANT: If you want to switch to a CLJS REPL this may require additional setup in the tool you used to start the server in. Since `lein` will default to using nREPL it will require configuring additional nREPL `:middleware`. When using `clj` you are good to go since it doesn't use nREPL.
