== About this Book

=== Work in Progress

This is a work in progress. If you find an error, please submit a PR to fix it, or an issue with details of the problem.

=== Contributing

This source for this book is hosted on https://github.com/shadow-cljs/shadow-cljs.github.io[Github].

=== Conventions Used

There are many examples in this book. Most things used in these should be obvious from their context,
but to prevent misunderstanding it is important to know the author's intentions.

When command-line examples are given we may include BASH comments (starting with `#`), and will
usually include the standard user UNIX prompt of `$` to indicate separation of the command
from its output.

```bash
# A comment. This command lists files:
$ ls -l
shadow-cljs.edn
project.clj
...
```

Many of the examples are of the configuration file for the compiler. This file contains an EDN map. Where we have already discussed required options we will often elide them for clarity. In this case we'll usually include an ellipsis to indicate "content that is required but isn't in our current focus":

.Example 1. Specify dependencies
```
{:dependencies [[lib "1.0"]]}
```

.Example 2. Add source paths
```
{...
 :source-paths ["src"]
 ...}
```

This allows us to concisely include enough context to understand the nesting of the configuration of
interest:

.Example 3. Nested option
```
{...
 :builds {:build-id {...
                     :output-dir "resources/public/js"}}}
```

Code examples may be similarly shortened.


= Installation

== Standalone via `npm`

You will need:

- https://nodejs.org[`node.js`] (v6.0.0+, most recent version preferred)
- https://www.npmjs.com[`npm`] or https://www.yarnpkg.com[`yarn`]
- Java SDK (Version 8). http://openjdk.java.net/install/[OpenJDK] or http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle]

.NPM
```bash
$ npm install --save-dev shadow-cljs
$ npm install -g shadow-cljs
```

.Yarn
```bash
$ yarn add --dev shadow-cljs
$ yarn global add shadow-cljs
```

== Library

Although it is recommended to run the standalone version via `npm` you can also embed `shadow-cljs` into any other Clojure JVM tool (eg. `lein`, `boot`, ...).

The artifact can be found at:

= Usage

include::usage.adoc[]

= Configuration

`shadow-cljs` is configured by a `shadow-cljs.edn` file in your project root directory. You can
create a default one by running `shadow-cljs init`. It should contain a map with some global
configuration and a `:builds` entry for all your builds.

```
{:source-paths [...]
 :dependencies [...]
 :builds {...}}
```

An example config could look like this:

```clojure
{:dependencies
 [[reagent "0.8.0-alpha2"]]

 :source-paths
 ["src"]

 :builds
 {:app {:target :browser
        :output-dir "public/js"
        :asset-path "/js"
        :modules {:main {:entries [my.app]}}}}}
```

The file structure for this example should look like this:
```text
.
├── package.json
├── shadow-cljs.edn
└── src
    └── my
        └── app.cljs
```

== Source Paths

`:source-paths` configures your JVM classpath. The compiler will use this config to find Clojure(Script) source files (eg. `.cljs`).

It is fine to put everything into one source path but you can use multiple if you want to "group" source files in certain ways. It is useful if you want to keep your tests separate for example.

.Using multiple source paths
```
{:source-paths ["src/main" "src/test"]
 ...}
```

.File Structure
```text
.
├── package.json
├── shadow-cljs.edn
└── src
    └── main
        └── my
            └── app.cljs
    └── test
        └── my
            └── app_test.cljs
```

It is not recommended to separate source files by extension (eg. `src/clj`, `src/cljs`, `src/cljc`). For some reason this is widely used in CLJS project templates but it just makes things harder to use.

== Dependencies

=== Clojure(Script)

Your dependencies are managed via the `:dependencies` key at the root of the `shadow-cljs.edn` config file. They are declared in the same notation that other Clojure tools like `lein` or `boot` use.

Notice that the source path is *only* specified once in the entire configuration. The system will use namespace dependency graphs to determine what code is needed in the final output of any given build.

=== JavaScript [[npm-install]]

`shadow-cljs` integrates fully with the https://www.npmjs.com/[`npm`] ecosystem to manage JavaScript dependencies.

You can use `npm` or `yarn` to manage your dependencies, please refer to their respective documentation.

[horizontal]
npm:: https://docs.npmjs.com/
yarn:: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs

Both manage your dependencies via a `package.json` file in your project directory.  Almost every package available via `npm` will explain how to install it. Those instructions now apply to `shadow-cljs` as well.

.Installing a JavaScript package
```bash
# npm
$ npm install the-thing

# yarn
$ yarn add the-thing
```

Nothing more is required. Dependencies will be added to the `package.json` file and this will be used to manage them.

TIP: If you don’t have a `package.json` yet run `npm init` from a command line.

==== Missing JS Dependency?

You might run into errors related to missing JS dependencies. Most ClojureScript libraries do not yet declare the `npm` packages they use since they still expect to use <<cljsjs, CLJSJS>>. We want to use `npm` directly which means you must manually install the `npm` packages until libraries properly declare the `:npm-deps` themselves.

```text
The required JS dependency "react" is not available, it was required by ...
```

This means that you should `npm install react`.

TIP: In the case of `react` you probably need these 3 packages: `npm install react react-dom create-react-class`.


== Server Options

This section is for other options that configure the `shadow-cljs` server instance. They are optional.

=== nREPL [[nREPL]]

The `shadow-cljs` <<server-mode, server>> provides a nREPL server via TCP. If you look at the startup message you'll see the port of nREPL, and the port will also be stored in `target/shadow-cljs/nrepl.port`:

```bash
$ shadow-cljs watch dev
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for ":app" available at http://localhost:8020
shadow-cljs - server running at http://0.0.0.0:9630
shadow-cljs - nrepl running at /0.0.0.0:9462
shadow-cljs - watching build :app
[:app] Configuring build.
[:app] Compiling ...
```

You can configure the port and additional middleware with `shadow-cljs.edn`:

```clojure
{...
 :nrepl {:port 9000
         :middleware []} ; optional list of namespace-qualified symbols
 ...}
```

If the popular middleware https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl[cider-nrepl] is found on the classpath (e.g. it's included in `:dependencies`), it will be used automatically. No additional configuration required.


You may configure the namespace you start in when connecting by setting `:init-ns` in the `:nrepl` options. It defaults to `shadow.user`.

```clojure
{...
 :nrepl {:init-ns my.repl}
 ...}
```

==== nREPL Usage

When connecting to the nREPL server the connection always starts out as a Clojure REPL. Switching to a CLJS REPL works similarly to the <<cljs-repl, non-nREPL version>>. First the `watch` for the given build needs to be started and then we need to select this build to switch the current nREPL session to that build. After selecting the build everything will be eval'd in ClojureScript instead of Clojure.


```repl
(shadow/watch :the-build)
(shadow/nrepl-select :the-build)
```

TIP: Use `:cljs/quit` to return to Clojure.

==== Embedded nREPL Server

When you use `shadow-cljs` embedded in other tools that provide their own nREPL server (eg. `lein`) you need to configure the `shadow-cljs` middleware. Otherwise you won't be able to switch between CLJ and CLJS REPLs.

.Example Leiningen `project.clj`
```clojure
(defproject my-amazing-project "1.0.0"
  ...
  :repl-options
  {:init-ns shadow.user ;; or any of your choosing
   :nrepl-middleware
   [shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/cljs-load-file
    shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/cljs-eval
    shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/cljs-select
    ;; required by some tools, not by shadow-cljs.
    cemerick.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]}
  ...)
```

TIP: You still need to start the <<embedded, embedded server>> manually before using the CLJS REPL.

=== SSL

The `shadow-cljs` HTTP servers support SSL. It requires a Java Keystore that provides a matching private key and certificate.

.`shadow-cljs.edn` with SSL configured
```
{...
 :ssl {:keystore "ssl/keystore.jks"
       :password "shadow-cljs"}
 ...}
```

The above are the defaults so if you want to use those it is fine to just set `:ssl {}`.


You can create a Keystore using the java `keytool` command. Creating a trusted self-signed certificate is also possible but somewhat complicated.

- https://gist.github.com/jchandra74/36d5f8d0e11960dd8f80260801109ab0[OpenSSL] instructions for Linux and Windows (via WSL)
- https://certsimple.com/blog/localhost-ssl-fix[macOS] instructions

The created `Certificates.p12` (macOS) or `localhost.pfx` (Linux, Windows) file can be turned into the required `keystore.jks` via the `keytool` utility.

```bash
$ keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore keystore.jks -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srckeystore localhost.pfx
```

IMPORTANT: You must generate the Certificate with a SAN (Subject Alternative Name) for "localhost" (or whichever host you want to use). SAN is required to get Chrome to trust the Certificate and now show warnings. The password used when exporting must match the password assigned to the Keystore.

// TODO: full guide, other platforms

=== HTTP(S) [[http]]

The `shadow-cljs` server starts one primary HTTP server. It is used by the builds to connect the Hot Reload and REPL clients via websocket. By default it listens on Port 9630. If that Port is in use it will increment by one and attempt again until an open Port is found.

.Startup message indicating the Port used
```bash
shadow-cljs - server running at http://0.0.0.0:9630
```

When `:ssl` is configured the server will be available via `https://` instead.

TIP: The server automatically supports HTTP/2 when using `:ssl`.

The UI served by this server is still in development so the main purpose of this HTTP server currently is serving the websockets.

If you prefer to set your own port instead you can do this via the `:http` config.

.`shadow-cljs.edn` with `:http` config
```
{...
 :http {:port 12345
        :host "my.machine.local"}
 ...}
```

`:ssl` switches the server to server `https://` only. If you want to keep the `http://` version you can configure a separate `:ssl-port` as well.

```
{...
 :http {:port 12345
        :ssl-port 23456
        :host "localhost"}
 ...}
```
= Build Configuration

= Targeting the Browser [[target-browser]]

= Targeting node.js [[target-node]]

There is built-in support for generating code that is intended to be used as a stand-alone
script, and also for code that is intended to be used as a library. See the
section on <<CommonConfig,common configuration>> for the base settings needed in
a configuration file.

NOTE: The optimizations in node at the time of this writing default to `:simple`.
You can use the normal configuration options to set the <<Optimization, optimization level>>.

== node.js Libraries [[target-node-library]]

include::target-node-library.adoc[]

== Creating `npm` packages

// TODO: Thomas: I think it would be useful to show a package.json and a little bit of an example
// on how you could set up to deploy this on NPM.

= Embedding in the JS Ecosystem -- The `:npm-module` Target [[target-npm-module]]

include::target-npm-module.adoc[]

= Testing

`shadow-cljs` provides a few ultility targets to make building tests a little easier.

All test targets generate a test runner and automatically add all namespaces matching the configurable `:ns-regexp`. The default test runners were built for `cljs.test` but you can create custom runners if you prefer to use other test frameworks.

The default `:ns-regexp` is `"-test$"`, so your first test could look like:

.File: `src/test/demo/app_test.cljs`
```clojure
(ns demo.app-test
  (:require [cljs.test :refer (deftest is)]))

(deftest a-failing-test
  (is (= 1 2))
```

In the Clojure world it is common to keep test files in their own source paths so the above example assumes you have configured `:source-paths ["src/main" "src/test"]` in your `shadow-cljs.edn` config. Your usual app code goes into `src/main` and the tests go into `src/test`. This however is optional and it is totally fine to keep everything in `src` and just use `:source-paths ["src"]`.

= What to do when things don’t work?

Since the JS world is still evolving rapidly and not everyone is using the same way to write and
distribute code there are some things `shadow-cljs` cannot work around automatically. These
can usually be solved with custom `:resolve` configs, but there may also be bugs or oversights.

If you cannot resolve such an issue with the instructions in this chapter, then try asking on the
https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/C6N245JGG[`#shadow-cljs` Slack channel].

= Hacking

== Patching Libraries

The `shadow-cljs` compiler ensures that things on your source paths are compiled first, overriding files from JARs. This means that you can copy a source file from a library, patch it, and include it in your own source directory.

This is a convenient way to test out fixes (even to `shadow-cljs` itself!) without having to clone
that project and understand its setup, build, etc.
