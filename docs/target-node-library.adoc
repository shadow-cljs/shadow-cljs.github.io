The `:target :node-library` emits code that can be used (via `require`) as a standard node library, and is
useful for publishing your code for re-use as a compiled Javascript artifact.

As with other modes the <<CommonConfig, main configuration options>> apply and must be set.
The target-specific options are:

[horizontal]
`:target`:: Use :node-library
`:output-to`:: (required). The path and filename for the generated library.
`:output-dir`:: (optional). The path for supporting files in development mode. Defaults to a cache directory.

The hot code reload story is similar to <<NodeHotCodeReload, the script target>>, but may not work as well
since it cannot as easily control all of the code that is loaded.

Controlling what code is actually exported is done via one of the following options:

- `:exports` -  a map of keyword to fully qualified symbols
- `:exports-var` - a fully qualified symbol
- `:exports-fn` - a fully qualified symbol

=== Single static "default" export

`:exports-var` will just return whatever is declared under that var. It can point to a `defn` or normal `def`.



.Build config using `:exports-var`
```
{...
 :builds {:lib {:output-to "lib.js"
                :exports-var demo.ns/f
                ...}}}
```
.Example CLJS
```
(ns demo.ns)

(defn f [...] ...)
;; OR
(def f #js {:foo ...})
```

.Consuming the generated code
```bash
$ node
> var f = require('./lib.js');
f(); // the actual demo.ns/f function
```

It is effectively generating `module.exports = demo.ns.f;`

=== Multiple static named exports

.Build configuration with multiple exports
```
{...
 :builds {:lib {:exports {:g       demo.ns/f
                          :h       other.ns/thing
                          :ns/ok?  another.ns/ok?}
                ...}}}
```

The keyword is used as the name of the entry in the exported object. *No munging is done* to this keyword name
(but namespaces are dropped). So, the above example maps cljs `f` to `g`, etc.:

```bash
$ node
> var lib = require('./lib.js');
lib.g(); // call demo-ns/f
lib["ok?"](); // call another-ns/ok?
```

You can achieve the exact same thing by using `:exports-var` pointing to a `def`

```
(def exports #js {:g f
                  ...})
```

=== "Dynamic" exports

In addition you may specify `:exports-fn` as a fully qualified symbol. This should point to a function with no arguments which should return a JS object (or function). This function will only ever be called ONCE as `node` caches the return value.

```clojure
(ns demo.ns
  (:require [demo.other :as other]))

(defn generate-exports []
  #js {:hello hello
       :foo other/foo})
```


```clojure
{...
 :builds {:lib {:exports-fn demo.ns/generate-exports
                ...}}}
```

NOTE: The exports config automatically tracks exported symbols and passes them on to the optimization stage. This means that anything listed in `:exports` will not be renamed by Google Closure optimizations.

=== Full Example

The example below creates a `lib.js` file intended to be consumed via the normal Node `require` mechanism.

```
(ns demo.lib)

(defn hello []
  (prn "hello")
  "hello")
```

The build configuration would be:

```
{...
 :builds {:library {:target    :node-library
                    :output-to "out/demo-library/lib.js"
                    :exports   {:hello demo.lib/hello}}}}
```

and the runtime use is as you would expect:

```
$ cd out/demo-library
$ node
> var x = require('./lib');
undefined
> x.hello()
hello
'hello'
```

As `:node-script` this will only create the file specified in `:output-to`. The `:exports` map maps CLJS vars to the name they should be exported to.

NOTE: Development mode has the <<NodeModes,same setup>> as for node scripts (extra dependencies).
