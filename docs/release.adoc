Development mode always outputs individual files for each namespace so that they can be hot loaded
in isolation. When you're ready to deploy code to a real server you want to run the Closure Compiler
on it to generate a single minified result for each <<Modules, module>>.

By default the release mode output file should just be a drop-in replacements for the
development mode file: there is no difference in the way you include them in your HTML. You
may use <<NameHashing, filename hashing>> to improve caching characteristics on browser targets.

.Generating Minified Output
```
$ shadow-cljs release build-id
```

== Release Configuration

Usually you won't need to add any extra configuration to create a release version for your build. The default config already captures everything necessary and should only require extra configuration if you want to override the defaults.

Each `:target` already provides good defaults optimized for each platform so you'll have less to worry about.

=== Optimizations [[Optimization]]

You can choose the optimization level using the `:compiler-options` section of the configuration:

IMPORTANT: You do not usually need to set `:optimizations` since the `:target` already sets it to an appropriate level.

IMPORTANT: `:optimizations` only apply when using the `release` command. Development builds are never optimized by the Closure Compiler. Development builds are always set to `:none`.

```clojure
{...
 :build
   {:build-id
     {...
      :compiler-options {:optimizations :simple}}}}
```

See the https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels[the Closure compiler's documentation]
for more information on available optimization levels.

=== Release-Specific vs. Development Configuration

If you wish to have separate configuration values in a build when running a release build then you
can override settings by including a `:dev` and/or `:release` section in the build section:

.Example `shadow-cljs.edn` build config
```clojure
{:source-paths ["src"]
 :dependencies []
 :builds
 {:app
  {:target :browser
   :output-dir "public/js"
   :asset-path "/js"
   :modules {:base {:entries [my.app.core]}}

   ;; Here is some dev-specific config
   :dev {:compiler-options {:devcards true}}

   ;; Here is some production config
   :release {:compiler-options {:optimizations :simple}}}}}
```

== Externs [[externs]]

Since we want builds to be fully optimized by the Closure Compiler `:advanced` compilation we need to deal with https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3[Externs]. Externs represent pieces of code that are not included when doing `:advanced` compilation. `:advanced` works by doing whole program optimizations but some code we just won't be able to include so Externs inform the Compiler about this code. Without Externs the Compiler may rename or remove some code that it shouldn't.

Typically all JS Dependencies are foreign and won't be passed through `:advanced` and thus require Externs.

TIP: Externs are only required for `:advanced`, they are not required in `:simple` mode.

=== Externs Inference [[infer-externs]]

To help deal with Externs the `shadow-cljs` compiler provides enhanced externs inference, which is enabled by default. The compiler will perform additional checks at compile time for your files only. It won't warn you about possible externs issues in library code.

You'll get warnings whenever the Compiler cannot figure out whether you are working with JS or CLJS code. If you don't get any warnings you should be OK.

.Example Code
```
(defn wrap-baz [x]
  (.baz x))
```

.Example Warning
```text
------ WARNING #1 --------------------------------------------------------------
 File: ~/project/src/demo/thing.cljs:23:3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  21 |
  22 | (defn wrap-baz [x]
  23 |   (.baz x))
---------^----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cannot infer target type in expression (. x baz)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

In `:advanced` the compiler might be renaming `.baz` to something "shorter" and Externs inform the Compiler that this is an external property that should not be renamed.

The warning tells you that the compiler did not recognize the property `baz` in the `x` binding. `shadow-cljs` can generate the appropriate externs if you add a typehint to the object you are performing native interop on.

.Type-hint to help externs generation
```clojure
(defn wrap-baz [x]
  (.baz ^js x))
```

The `^js` typehint will cause the compiler to generate proper externs and the warning will go away. The property is now safe from renaming. You may either directly tag the interop form, or you may tag the variable name where it is first bound.

.Multiple interop calls
```clojure
(defn wrap-baz [x]
  (.foo ^js x)
  (.baz ^js x))
```

It can get tedious to annotate every single interop call, so you can annotate the variable binding itself. It will be used in the entire scope for this variable. Externs for both calls will still be generated. So, instead you do:

.Annotate `x` directly
```clojure
(defn wrap-baz [^js x]
  (.foo x)
  (.baz x))
```

IMPORTANT: Don't annotate everything with `^js`. Sometimes you may be doing interop on CLJS or ClosureJS objects. Those do not require externs. If you are certain you are working with a CLJS object use the `^clj` hint instead.
 It is not the end of the world to use `^js` incorrectly, but it may affect some optimizations when a variable is not renamed when it could be.

Calling a global using `js/` does not require a typehint.

.No hint required, externs inferred automatically
```
(js/Some.Thing.coolFunction)
```

Calls on `:require` bindings are also inferred automatically.

.No hint required for `:as` and `:refer` bindings
```
(ns my.app
  (:require ["react" :as react :refer (createElement)]))

(react/createElement "div" nil "hello world")
(createElement "div" nil "hello world")
```

=== Manual Externs

Some libraries provide Externs as separate `.js` files. You can include them into your build via the `:externs` compiler options.

.Manual Externs Config
```
{...
 :builds
 {:app
  {:target :browser
   ...
   :compiler-options {:externs ["path/to/externs.js" ...]}
   }}}
```

TIP: The compiler looks for files relative to the project root first. It will also attempt to load them from the classpath if no file is found.

=== Simplified Externs

Writing Externs by hand can be challenging and `shadow-cljs` provides a way to write a more convenient way to write them. In combination with `shadow-cljs check <your-build>` you can quickly add the missing Externs.

Start by creating a `externs/<your-build>.txt`, so build `:app` would be `externs/app.txt`. In that file each line should be one word specifying a JS property that should not be renamed. Global variables should be prefixed by `global:`

.Example externs/app.txt
```
# this is a comment
foo
bar
global:SomeGlobalVariable
```

In this example the compiler will stop renaming `something.foo()`, `something.bar()`.

== Build Report [[build-report]]

`shadow-cljs` can generate a detailed report for your `release` builds which includes a detailed breakdown of the included sources and how much they each contributed to the overall size.

A sample report can be found https://code.thheller.com/demos/build-report/ui-report.html[here].

The report can either be generated by running a separate command or by configuring a <<build-hooks, build hook>> for your build.

.Command Example
```bash
$ npx shadow-cljs run shadow.cljs.build-report <build-id> <path/to/output.html>
# example
$ npx shadow-cljs run shadow.cljs.build-report app report.html
```

The above example will generate a `report.html` in the project directory for the `:app` build.

TIP: The generated HTML file is entirely self-contained and includes all the required data/js/css. No other external sources are required.

.Build Hook Example
```clojure
{...
 :builds
 {:app
  {:target :browser
   :output-dir "public/js"
   :modules ...
   :build-hooks
   [(shadow.cljs.build-report/hook)]
   }}}
```

This will generate a `report.html` in the configured `public/js` output directory for every `release` build automatically. This can be configured where this is written to by supplying an extra `:output-to` option. This path is then treated as relative to the project directory, not the `:output-dir`.

.Build Hook with :output-to
```clojure
{...
 :builds
 {:app
  {:target :browser
   :output-dir "public/js"
   :modules ...
   :build-hooks
   [(shadow.cljs.build-report/hook
      {:output-to "tmp/report.html"})]
   }}}
```

Only `release` builds will produce a report when using the hook, it does not affect `watch` or `compile`.

IMPORTANT: The build report is generated by parsing the source maps, so the hook will automatically force the generation of source maps. The files won't be linked from the `.js` files directly, unless you actually enabled them via `:compiler-options {:source-map true}` yourself.


The dedicated build report command runs separately from watches you may have running. You do not need to stop any of them nor do you need to stop the shadow-cljs server before building the report.
