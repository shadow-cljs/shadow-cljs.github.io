The `:target :react-native` produces code that is meant to integrate into the default `react-native` tooling (eg. `metro`). Tools like `expo` which wrap those tools should automatically work and require no additional setup.

You will need the same basic <<config,main configuration>> as in other targets (like
`:source-paths`), the build specific config is very minimal and requires at least 2 options (besides `:target` itself)

[horizontal]
`:init-fn`:: (required). The namespace-qualified symbol of your apps init function. This function will be called once on startup and should probably render something.
`:output-dir`:: (required). The directory used to write output files.

// TODO: Thomas mentioned that node can be picky and sometimes output-dir is useful...an example would be nice.

.Sample :react-native config
```
{:source-paths [...]
 :dependencies [...]
 ...
 :builds
 {:app
  {:target :react-native
   :init-fn demo.app/init
   :output-dir "app"}}}
```

When compiled this results in a `app/index.js` file intended to be used as an entry point for the `react-native` tools. During development the `:output-dir` will contain many more files but you should only reference the generated `app/index.js` directly. A `release` build will only generate the optimized `app/index.js` and requires no additional files.

== React Native

There are two ways to use `react-native`, "plain" `react-native`, which allows you to use native code and libraries and the one "wrapped" in https://expo.io/[expo] (described below). All the steps described above are sufficient to start using shadow-cljs with the plain `react-native`. See this example repo:

- https://github.com/thheller/reagent-react-native

== Expo

https://expo.io/[expo] makes working with `react-native` quite easy. There are two provided example setups.

- https://github.com/thheller/fulcro-expo
- https://github.com/thheller/reagent-expo

Both examples were generated using `expo init ...` and the only adjusted change in the config was adding the proper `entryPoint` to the generated `app.json`.

```
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "hello-world",
    "slug": "reagent-expo",
    ...
    "entryPoint":"./app/index.js",
    ...
  }
}
```

`expo` requires that a React Component is registered on startup which can be done manually or by using the `shadow.expo/render-root` function which takes care of creating the Component and instead directly expects a React Element instance to start rendering.

.From the Reagent https://github.com/thheller/reagent-expo/blob/2c73ed0513a8f5050b250c0c7e53b9ae7543cee9/src/main/test/app.cljs#L34-L40[example]
```
(defn start
  {:dev/after-load true}
  []
  (expo/render-root (r/as-element [root])))

(defn init []
  (start))
```

`init` is called once on startup. Since the example doesn't need to do any special setup it just calls `start` directly. `start` will be called repeatedly when `watch` is running each time after the code changes were reloaded. The `reagent.core/as-element` function can be used to generate the required React Element from the reagent hiccup markup.
