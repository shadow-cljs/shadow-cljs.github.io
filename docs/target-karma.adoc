When you want to run your CLJS tests against a browser on some kind of CI server you'll need to
be able to run the tests from a command line and get back a status code. Karma is a well-known
and supported test runner that can do this for you, and `shadow-cljs` includes a target that
can add the appropriate wrappers around your tests so they will work in it.

=== Installing Karma

See their http://karma-runner.github.io[website] for full instructions. You'll typically need
something like this in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "CITests",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Testing",
  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "karma": "^2.0.0",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "^2.2.0",
    "karma-cljs-test": "^0.1.0",
    ...
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

So, you need Karma, a browser launcher, and the cljs-test integration.

=== The Build

The build options are:

[horizontal]
`:target`::     `:karma`
`:output-to`::  A path/filename for the js file.
`:ns-regexp`::  (optional) A regex to match the test namespaces, defaults to "-test$
`:runner-ns`:: (optional) A namespace that can contain a start, stop, and init function. Defaults to
`shadow.test.karma`.

So you might have something like this:

```
{...
 :builds
 {:ci
  {:target :karma
   :output-to  "target/ci.js"
   :ns-regexp  "-spec$"}}}
```

You also need a `karma.conf.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function (config) {
    config.set({
        browsers: ['ChromeHeadless'],
        // The directory where the output file lives
        basePath: 'target',
        // The file itself
        files: ['ci.js'],
        frameworks: ['cljs-test'],
        plugins: ['karma-cljs-test', 'karma-chrome-launcher'],
        colors: true,
        logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,
        client: {
            args: ["shadow.test.karma.init"],
            singleRun: true
        }
    })
};
```

then you can run the tests as follows (assuming you've installed global executables of the tools):

```bash
$ shadow-cljs compile ci
$ karma start --single-run
12 01 2018 01:19:24.222:INFO [karma]: Karma v2.0.0 server started at http://0.0.0.0:9876/
12 01 2018 01:19:24.224:INFO [launcher]: Launching browser ChromeHeadless with unlimited concurrency
12 01 2018 01:19:24.231:INFO [launcher]: Starting browser ChromeHeadless
12 01 2018 01:19:24.478:INFO [HeadlessChrome 0.0.0 (Mac OS X 10.12.6)]: Connected on socket TcfrjxVKmx7xN6enAAAA with id 85554456
LOG: 'Testing boo.sample-spec'
HeadlessChrome 0.0.0 (Mac OS X 10.12.6): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.007 secs / 0.002 secs)
```

In case you need to perform extra initialization steps before the tests are run you can do so by supplying a custom `:runner-ns`, which might look like this:

```cljs
(ns myapp.karma
  (:require [shadow.test.karma]))

(defn ^:export init []
  (my-extra-init-step)
  (shadow.test.karma/init))
```

Then in the build config add `:runner-ns myapp.karma`.
