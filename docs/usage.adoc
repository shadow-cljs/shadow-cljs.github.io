= Usage

`shadow-cljs` can be used in many different ways but the general workflow stays the same.

During development you have the option to `compile` a build once or run a `watch` worker which watches your source files for changes and re-compiles them automatically. When <<devtools, enabled>> the `watch` will also hot-reload your code and provide a REPL. During development the focus is on developer experience with fast feedback cycles. Development code should never be shipped to the public.

When it is time to get serious you create a <<release, `release`>> build which creates an optimized build suitable for production. For this the https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/[Closure Compiler] is used which applies some seriously `:advanced` optimizations to your code to create the most optimal output available. This may require some <<externs, tuning>> to work properly when using lots of interop with native JavaScript but works flawlessly for ClojureScript (and the code from the https://developers.google.com/closure/library/[Closure Library]).


== Command Line

If <<Installation, installed>> globally, you can use the `shadow-cljs` command directly.

```bash
$ shadow-cljs help
```

If you prefer to only use the local `npm` install you can invoke it via `npx` or `yarn`.

```bash
# npm
$ npx shadow-cljs help

# yarn
$ yarn shadow-cljs help

# manually
$ ./node_modules/.bin/shadow-cljs help
```

The guide will assume there is a global install to keep examples short but this is not required.

.Commonly used shadow-cljs commands during development
```bash
# compile a build once and exit
$ shadow-cljs compile app

# compile and watch
$ shadow-cljs watch app

# connect to REPL for the build (available while watch is running)
$ shadow-cljs cljs-repl app

# connect to standalone node repl
$ shadow-cljs node-repl
```

.Running a release build optimized for production use.
```
$ shadow-cljs release app
```

Sometimes you may run into some release issues due to `:advanced` compilation. These
commands can help track down the causes.

.Release debugging commands.
```
$ shadow-cljs check app
$ shadow-cljs release app --debug
```

=== Server Mode [[server-mode]]

A `shadow-cljs` command can be fairly slow to start. To improve this `shadow-cljs` can run in "server mode" which means that a dedicated process is started which all other commands can use to execute a lot faster since they won't have to start a new JVM/Clojure instance.

Commands that do long-running things implicitly start a server instance (eg. `watch`) but it is often advisable to have
a dedicated server process running.

You can run the process in the foreground in a dedicated terminal. Use `CTRL+C` to terminate the server.

```bash
$ shadow-cljs server

# or (if you'd like REPL to control the server process)
$ shadow-cljs clj-repl
```

You can also run the server in the background controlled via the common `start|stop|restart` functions.

```bash
$ shadow-cljs start
$ shadow-cljs stop
$ shadow-cljs restart
```

Once any server is running every other command will use that and run much faster.

== Build Tool Integration

`shadow-cljs` can integrate with other Clojure tools since the primary distribution is just a `.jar` file available via https://clojars.org/thheller/shadow-cljs[Clojars]. By default your `:dependencies` are managed via `shadow-cljs.edn` but you can use other builds tools to manage your dependencies as well.

CAUTION: It is strongly recommended to use the standalone `shadow-cljs` version. The command does a lot of things to optimize the user experience (e.g. faster startup) which are not done by other tools. You'll also save yourself a lot of headaches dealing with dependency conflicts and other related errors.

=== Leiningen [[Leiningen]]

If you'd like to use https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] to manage your dependencies, you can do so by adding a `:lein` entry to your `shadow-cljs.edn` config. With this setting, the `shadow-cljs` command will use `lein` to launch the JVM, ignoring any `:source-paths` and `:dependencies` in `shadow-cljs.edn`; relying instead on `lein` to set them from `project.clj`.

```
{:lein true
 ; :source-paths and :dependencies are now ignored in this file
 ; configure them via project.clj
 :builds { ... }
```

.Using a dedicated `lein` profile
```
{:lein {:profile "+cljs"}
 :builds {...}}
```
.Sample project.clj
```
(defproject my-awesome-project
  ...
  :profiles
  {:cljs
   {:source-paths ["src/cljs"]
    :dependencies [[thheller/shadow-cljs "..."]
                   [reagent "0.8.1"]]}})
```

When using `project.clj` to manage your `:dependencies` you must manually include the https://clojars.org/thheller/shadow-cljs[thheller/shadow-cljs] artifact in your `:dependencies` (directly or in a profile).

IMPORTANT: When you are running into weird Java Stackstraces when starting `shadow-cljs` or trying compile builds you may have a dependency conflict. It is very important that `shadow-cljs` is used with proper matching `org.clojure/clojurescript` and `closure-compiler` versions. You can check via `lein deps :tree` and the required versions are listed on https://clojars.org/thheller/shadow-cljs[clojars] (on the right side).

==== Running Tasks Directly From Leiningen

You may also directly execute `shadow-cljs` commands via `lein` if you prefer to not use the `shadow-cljs` command itself.

IMPORTANT: It is recommended to still use the `shadow-cljs` command to run commands since that will take full advantage of a running server mode instance. This will run commands substantially faster than launching additional JVMs when using `lein` directly.


.Just compile :dev mode once, no REPL or live-reload:
```bash
$ lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli compile build-id
```

.Create a :release mode optimized build:
```bash
$ lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli release build-id
```

=== tools.deps / deps.edn [[deps-edn]]

The new https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli[deps.edn] can also be used to manage your `:dependencies` and `:source-paths` instead of using the built-in methods or `lein`. All `shadow-cljs` commands will then be launched via the new `clojure` utility instead.

IMPORTANT: `tools.deps` is still changing quite frequently. Make sure you are using the latest version.

To use this set the `:deps true` property in your config. It is also possible to configure which `deps.edn` aliases should be used.

You must add the `thheller/shadow-cljs` artifact to your `deps.edn` manually.

.Simple `shadow-cljs.edn` example
```clojure
{:deps true
 :builds ...}
```

.Simple `deps.edn` example
```clojure
{:paths [...]
 :deps {thheller/shadow-cljs {:mvn/version <latest>}}}
```

.Example `shadow-cljs.edn` with :cljs alias
```clojure
{:deps {:aliases [:cljs]}
 :builds ...}
```

.Example `deps.edn`
```clojure
{:paths [...]
 :deps {...}
 :aliases
 {:cljs
  {:extra-deps {thheller/shadow-cljs {:mvn/version <latest>}}}}
```

Running with `clj` directly.
```
{:paths [...]
 :deps {...}
 :aliases
 {:shadow-cljs
  {:extra-deps {thheller/shadow-cljs {:mvn/version <latest>}}
   :main-opts ["-m" "shadow.cljs.devtools.cli"]}}}
```

```
clj -A:shadow-cljs watch app
```

You may also specify additional aliases via the command line using `-A`, eg. `shadow-cljs -A:foo:bar ...`.

IMPORTANT: Aliases are only applied when a new instance/server is started. They do not apply when connecting to a running server using the `shadow-cljs` command. Running via `clj` will always start a new JVM and does not support server-mode.

=== Boot

The authors have little Boot experience, so this chapter is in need of contributions. We understand
that Boot allows you to build your tool chain out of functions. Since `shadow-cljs` is a normal
JVM library, you can call functions within it to invoke tasks.

Some boot tasks are available here:
https://github.com/jgdavey/boot-shadow-cljs

== Running Clojure Code [[clj-run]]

You can use the `shadow-cljs` CLI to call specific Clojure functions from the command line. This is useful when you want to run some code before/after certain tasks. Suppose you wanted to `rsync` the output of your `release` build to a remote server.

.Example Clojure Namespace in `src/my/build.clj`
```clojure
(ns my.build
  (:require
    [shadow.cljs.devtools.api :as shadow]
    [clojure.java.shell :refer (sh)]))

(defn release []
  (shadow/release :my-build)
  (sh "rsync" "-arzt" "path/to/output-dir" "my@server.com:some/path"))
```

.Running the `release` function
```bash
$ shadow-cljs clj-run my.build/release
# or
$ shadow-cljs run my.build/release
```

You can pass arguments to the invoked functions via the command line.

.Using arguments via normal Clojure fn args
```clojure
...
(defn release [server]
  (shadow/release :my-build)
  (sh "rsync" "-arzt" "path/to/output-dir" server))
```

.Passing the server from the command line
```bash
$ shadow-cljs clj-run my.build/release my@server.com:some/path
```

TIP: The usual `(defn release [& args])` structure also works if you want to parse the args with something like https://github.com/clojure/tools.cli[tools.cli].

You have access to the full power of Clojure here. You can build entire tools on top of this if you like. As a bonus everything you write this way is also directly available via the Clojure REPL.

IMPORTANT: When the <<server-mode, server>> is running the namespace will not be reloaded automatically, it will only be loaded once. It is recommended to do the development using a REPL and reload the file as usual (eg. `(require 'my.build :reload)`). You may also run `shadow-cljs clj-eval "(require 'my.build :reload)"` to reload manually from the command line.


=== Calling watch via clj-run

By default the functions called by `clj-run` only have access to a minimal `shadow-cljs` runtime which is enough to run `compile`, `release` and any other Clojure functionality. The JVM will terminate when your function completes.

If you want to start a `watch` for a given build you need to declare that the function you are calling requires a full server. This will cause the process to stay alive until you explicitly call `(shadow.cljs.devtools.server/stop!)` or `CTRL+C` the process.

```clojure
(ns demo.run
  (:require [shadow.cljs.devtools.api :as shadow]))

;; this fails because a full server instance is missing
(defn foo
  [& args]
  (shadow/watch :my-build))

;; this metadata will ensure that the server is started so watch works
(defn foo
  {:shadow/requires-server true}
  [& args]
  (shadow/watch :my-build))
```
