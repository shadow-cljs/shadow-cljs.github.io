Unfortunately most editors these days expect you to work with the Leiningen `project.clj` setup so you might need to use the <<Leiningen, Leiningen integration>> for them to work properly.

== Cursive

Cursive does not currently support resolving dependencies via `shadow-cljs.edn`. You can run `shadow-cljs pom` to generate a `pom.xml` and import that using the IntelliJ.

Alternatively you can create a dummy `project.clj` or use the full <<Leiningen, Leiningen integration>>.

```
(defproject your/project "0.0.0"
  :dependencies
  [[thheller/shadow-cljs "2.0.150"]]

  :source-paths
  ["src"])
```

You can run `npx shadow-cljs server` inside the Terminal provided by IntelliJ and use `Clojure REPL -> Remote` Run Configuration to connect to the provided <<nREPL, nREPL server>>.


== emacs / cider [[cider]]

https://github.com/shadow-cljs/shadow-cljs.github.io[HELP WANTED!]

The generic <<nrepl, nREPL>> instructions should provide everything required but additional config might be required.

1) Load your project in emacs.
2) Issue a `M-x cider-connect` command.
3) Change to the `cider-repl` buffer that should be created after a successful connection.
4) Check for any warning messages. If needed, update config and re-connect.
5) At the prompt in the `cider-repl` buffer: `(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :<your-build-here>)`
6) Change to a buffer with cljs source code, and verify that `jump-to-var` and other eval commands work.

== Proto REPL (Atom)

Proto REPL is mostly intended for Clojure development so most features do not work for ClojureScript. It is however possible to use it for simple evals.

You need to setup a couple of things to get it working.

1)  Create a `user.clj` in on of your `:source-paths`.

```clojure
 (ns user)

 (defn reset [])
```

The file must define the `user/reset` fn since Proto REPL will call that when connecting. If `user/reset` is not found it will call `tools.namespace` which destroys the running `shadow-cljs` server. We don't want that. You could do something here but we don't need to do anything for CLJS.

2) add `[proto-repl "0.3.1"]` to your `:dependencies`.

3) Configure a fixed <<nREPL, nREPL port>>

4) Start `shadow-cljs server` or `shadow-cljs watch your-build`.

5) Run the Atom Command `Proto Repl: Remote Nrepl Connection` connect to `localhost` and the port you configured

6) Eval `(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/watch :your-build)` (if you used `server` in 4)

7) Eval `(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :your-build)`. The REPL connection is now in CLJS mode, meaning that everything you eval will be eval'd in JS. You can eval `:repl/quit` to get back to Clojure Mode. If you get `[:no-worker :browser]` you need to start the `watch` first.

8) Before you can eval CLJS you need to connect your client (eg. your Browser when building a `:browser` App).

9) Eval some JS, eg. `(js/alert "foo")`. If you get `There is no connected JS runtime` the client is not connected properly. Otherwise the Browser should show an alert.
