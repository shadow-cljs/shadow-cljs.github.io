Unfortunately most editors these days expect you to work with the Leiningen `project.clj` setup so you might need to use the <<Leiningen, Leiningen integration>> for them to work properly.

== Cursive

Cursive does not currently support resolving dependencies via `shadow-cljs.edn`. You can run `shadow-cljs pom` to generate a `pom.xml` and import that using the IntelliJ.

Alternatively you can create a dummy `project.clj` or use the full <<Leiningen, Leiningen integration>>.

```
(defproject your/project "0.0.0"
  :dependencies
  [[thheller/shadow-cljs "X.Y.Z"]]

  :source-paths
  ["src"])
```

You can run `npx shadow-cljs server` inside the Terminal provided by IntelliJ and use `Clojure REPL -> Remote` Run Configuration to connect to the provided <<nREPL, nREPL server>>.

== Emacs / CIDER [[cider]]

This section is written for CIDER version 0.18.0 and above. Ensure your Emacs environment has this version of the `cider` package or later. Refer to the link:http://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[CIDER documentation] for full installation details.

=== Dependencies

Many of CIDER's features require corresponding middleware running in the server. Add CIDER's nREPL middleware to the `:dependencies` entry of `shadow-cljs.edn`:

```clojure
[cider/cider-nrepl "0.18.0"]
```

If you instead don't want to pollute your project files, you can add an alias to the global `$HOME/.clojure/deps.edn`:

```clojure
...
:aliases {:nrepl {:extra-deps {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.18.0"}}}
...
```

=== Launch the server

Launch the `shadow-cljs` server with a build target.

====
Launching with the `app` build target:

```bash
$ shadow-cljs watch app
```
====

Look at the startup message for the nREPL port (or see <<nREPL>> for further details):

====
The message to look for will be similar to this one, the port in this case is `9462`:

```
shadow-cljs - nrepl running at /0.0.0.0:9462
```
====

====
You can include `deps.edn` aliases with the -A command line parameter

```bash
$ shadow-cljs watch app -A:nrepl
```
====

=== Connect to CIDER for a Clojure REPL

In Emacs, connect to the running nREPL server:

```
M-x cider-connect
```

Enter the connection details:

```console
Host:
```

Enter `localhost`.

```console
Port for localhost:
```

Enter the nREPL port of the shadow-cljs and CIDER will connect to it, displaying a new `cider-repl` buffer:

```console
shadow.user>
```

=== Connect the JavaScript environment

If you haven't already done so, connect a JavaScript runtime to the shadow-cljs server. For example, for browser development, browse to `http://localhost:8080`.

In the `cider-repl` buffer, you should see a message:

```
JS runtime connected.
```

=== Launch the ClojureScript REPL

Launch the ClojureScript REPL alongside the Clojure REPL connection. Make sure you are in the `cider-repl` buffer so that Emacs knows which connection to use.

```console
M-x cider-create-sibling-cljs-repl
```

CIDER will prompt you for the type of ClojureScript REPL:

```console
Select ClojureScript REPL type:
```

Enter `shadow`.

```console
Select shadow-cljs build:
```

Enter the name of your build target, for example, `app`.

Emacs should now open a new nREPL connection to the `shadow-cljs` server of its sibling, bootstrapping into a ClojureScript REPL environment:

```console
shadow.user> To quit, type: :cljs/quit
[:selected :app]
cljs.repl>
```

You should now be able to eval ClojureScript, jump to the definitions of vars (with `cider-find-var`) and much more.

====
For example, to display an alert in the browser:

```console
cljs.repl> (js/alert "Jurassic Park!")
```
====

== Proto REPL (Atom)

Proto REPL is mostly intended for Clojure development so most features do not work for ClojureScript. It is however possible to use it for simple evals.

You need to setup a couple of things to get it working.

1)  Create a `user.clj` in on of your `:source-paths`.

```clojure
 (ns user)

 (defn reset [])
```

The file must define the `user/reset` fn since Proto REPL will call that when connecting. If `user/reset` is not found it will call `tools.namespace` which destroys the running `shadow-cljs` server. We don't want that. You could do something here but we don't need to do anything for CLJS.

2) add `[proto-repl "0.3.1"]` to your `:dependencies`.

3) Configure a fixed <<nREPL, nREPL port>>

4) Start `shadow-cljs server` or `shadow-cljs watch your-build`.

5) Run the Atom Command `Proto Repl: Remote Nrepl Connection` connect to `localhost` and the port you configured

6) Eval `(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/watch :your-build)` (if you used `server` in 4)

7) Eval `(shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select :your-build)`. The REPL connection is now in CLJS mode, meaning that everything you eval will be eval'd in JS. You can eval `:repl/quit` to get back to Clojure Mode. If you get `[:no-worker :browser]` you need to start the `watch` first.

8) Before you can eval CLJS you need to connect your client (eg. your Browser when building a `:browser` App).

9) Eval some JS, eg. `(js/alert "foo")`. If you get `There is no connected JS runtime` the client is not connected properly. Otherwise the Browser should show an alert.

== Calva (VS Code)

(Only tested with `browser` targets so far. Probably works with other targets too.)

=== Dependencies

You need VS Code and install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cospaia.clojure4vscode#overview[Calva] extension.

Since Calva uses nRepl and Cider you need to include this dependency in `shadow-cljs.edn`:

```clojure
[cider/cider-nrepl "0.16.0"]
```

`shadow-cljs` will inject the required `cider-nrepl` middleware once it sees this dependency.

=== Connecting Calva to the REPLs

Once that is done start your shadow app. (Using whatever build instead of `app`.):

```
$ shadow-cljs watch app
```

Once the app is loaded in the browser, and you see `JS runime connected` in the terminal where you started the app, Calva can connect to its repl. Open the project in VS Code and Calva will by default try to auto connect and prompt you with a list of builds read from `shadow-cljs.edn`. Select the right one (`:app` in this example) and Calva's Clojure and Clojurescript support is activated.

(If you already have the project open in VS Code when you start the app, issue the `clojure4vscode: connect` command.)

=== Features

Some of the things you can now do:

==== Intellisence and stuff

- Peek at definitions on hover.
- Get auto completion help.
- Navigate to definitions (`cmd-click` on Mac, might be `ctrl-click` on Windows and Linux).

==== Evaluation of the file, forms and selection

- Evaluate the file: `ctrl+alt+v enter` (This is done automatically one opening files.)
- Evaluate inline: `ctrl+alt+v e`
- Evaluate and replace them in the editor: `ctrl+alt+v r`
- Pretty print evaluation resuls: `ctrl+alt+v p`
- Send forms to the integrated terminal repls for evaluation: `ctrl+alt+v alt+e`

==== Run tests

- Run namespace tests: `ctrl+alt+v t`
- Run all tests: `ctrl+alt+v shift+t` (Really clunky in large projects so far.)
- Rerun previously failing tests: `ctrl+alt+v ctrl+t`
- Test failures are marked in the explorer and editors and listed in the Problem tab for easy access.

==== Terminal repls

- Show repl terminal: `ctrl+alt+v z`
- Switch namespace in terminal repl to that of the currently open file: `ctrl+alt+v n`
- Load current file and switch namespace in: `ctrl+alt+v alt+n`

==== Cljc files

- Switch between Clojure and Clojurescript repl `ctrl+alt+v alt+c` (or click the green `cljc/clj` button in the status bar). This determines both which repl is backing the editor and what terminal repl is being accessed, see above.
